## Overview

This repository contains the official implementation of **Continuous Degradation Modeling via Latent Flow Matching for Real-World Super-Resolution**.

<p align="center">

</p>

We propose **DegFlow**, a **continuous degradation modeling framework** for real-world super-resolution. During training, DegFlow learns **continuous degradation trajectories**, modeled with a **natural cubic spline**, in a constrained latent space using **Latent Flow Matching (LFM)**. At inference time, given only a **single HR input**, it synthesizes **realistic LR images at continuous scales**. The generated continuous-scale LR images provide **realistic supervision** beyond limited discrete real HR–LR pairs, leading to improved **real-world arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR)** performance.

### LPIPS-based Perceptual Supervision for Nonlinear Flow Matching

For **unseen intermediate degradation scales**, we extrapolate an intermediate latent toward the next discrete degradation level using a **third-order Taylor expansion**:

$$
\hat{z}_{t_{k+1}} = z_t + \hat{z}'_t \Delta t + \frac{1}{2} z''_t \Delta t^2 + \frac{1}{6} z'''_t \Delta t^3
$$

We then decode the extrapolated latent and compute the **LPIPS loss** against the ground-truth LR image at the next degradation level:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LPIPS}} = \mathrm{LPIPS}\left(I_{s_{k+1}}, D_\theta\left(\hat{z}_{t_{k+1}}\right)\right)
$$

This enables **perceptual supervision** even at **unseen intermediate degradation scales**, without requiring direct ground-truth LR images.

## Dataset Preparation

We use the **RealSR Version 2** dataset for both training and evaluation.

To be specific, we use a dataset reconstructed from **InterFlow**
(*Learning Controllable Degradation for Real-World Super-Resolution via Constrained Flows*),
containing only overlapping HR–LR pairs.

You may refer to the official
[InterFlow repository](https://github.com/dongjinkim9/InterFlow/blob/main/interflow/README.md#Training),
where the dataset is available for download.


After downloading, set the dataset root path in the config files:

`configs/datasets/realsr_train.yaml`

`configs/datasets/realsr_train_allscale.yaml`

`configs/datasets/realsr_test.yaml`

`configs/datasets/realsr_test_allscale.yaml`

```yaml
dataset:
  params:
    dataroot: '/path/to/RealSR_v2_ordered/'
```

We assume an ordered dataset structure such as `RealSR_v2_ordered`.
Please modify the dataset loader if your directory structure differs.

---

## Training

Training consists of two stages.

### Stage 1 — Train RAE (Residual Autoencoder)

```bash
python main.py --config configs/train_lit_ae.yaml
```

This stage trains the latent autoencoder to construct a constrained latent space.

---

### Stage 2 — Train LFM (Latent Flow Matching)

```bash
python main.py --config configs/train_lit_rf.yaml
```

This stage trains the latent flow model in the learned latent space.

---

## Dataset Generation

To generate arbitrary-scale real LR samples or latent trajectories, configure:

`configs/generate.yaml`

Set pretrained checkpoint paths:

```yaml
model:
  params:
    ae_config:
      checkpoint: /path/to/autoencoder_checkpoint.ckpt
    rf_config:
      checkpoint: /path/to/flow_model_checkpoint.ckpt
```

Run generation:

```bash
python generate.py --config configs/generate.yaml
```

### Generation with External HR-Only Datasets

Furthermore, DegFlow generation can also be performed using external datasets that contain **HR images only**.

For example, **DIV2K** is currently supported.
You can enable generation by configuring the `data` section as follows:

```yaml
data:
  target: datasets.data_module.GenerationDataModule
  params:
    dataset:
      target: datasets.dataset.DIV2K_HR_only_dataset
      params:
        root_dir: '/path/to/DIV2K dataset'
```

You can also perform generation with any custom dataset that contains HR images only by implementing or adapting a compatible dataset class.
